            <h1>MY PROJECTS</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my projects page, where you'll find a couple of works and projects that I delved into. Each project shows creativity, problem-solving, and technical expertise that I have garned through-out my course. From web applications that are eye-capturing and well functioning to unerway projects in future. With a keen eye for detail and a relentless pursuit of excellence, I strive to deliver solutions that not only meet but exceed expectations. Have a look at some of the projects that i have worked on.
